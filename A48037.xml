            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was about this time Twelvemonth that I wrote concerning the Peace which the <hi>French</hi> King did then offer to the <hi>Allies.</hi> You know the Reaſons which I then brought to demonſtrate the danger of accepting the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Deſign of that Crown was firſt to break the Union amongſt the Princes, who had Leagu'd themſelves againſt <hi>France</hi> for their own Preſervation; and then to accompliſh the entire ruine of all the States in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> And now that at preſent the <hi>French</hi> King inſiſts more than ever upon demanding a Peace, which he could never obtain ſince the preſent War; which I hope never ſhall, upon any other Conditions, than thoſe of the Treaties of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenees.</hi> I find my ſelf obliged to entertain you again with this Subject, and to diſcover the <hi>Fatal Snare</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> King lays for us.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble you, <hi>Sir,</hi> with the Reaſons that I formerly hinted, for I have others of greater Weight to Communicate, which will effectually prove that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable Peace which the <hi>French</hi> King does now offer, is not a Real Peace, and that if the ſame be accepted, it will certainly iſſue in the Ruine of this <hi>State,</hi> the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, Princes of the Empire,</hi> and other <hi>Soveraigns;</hi> and in a word, will Terminate in the <hi>Deſolation</hi> of <hi>Christendom</hi> and the <hi>Slavery</hi> of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſet this Truth in its full Light, we muſt conſider in the firſt place, what it is that the <hi>French</hi> King propoſed to himſelf by Attacking his Neighbours unjuſtly, and the pernicious Method which he made uſe of for that end. And in the next place, Let us conſider the Motives which prevail'd with the <hi>Confederates,</hi> to enter into ſuch a ſtrick, Alliance againſt <hi>France:</hi> And then let's Examine whether thoſe Motives have not the ſame Reaſon now which they had then, both as to the one and the other, that is to ſay, whether the <hi>French</hi> King hath chang'd his Conduct and Deſigns? And whether the <hi>Allies</hi> have as yet put him out of a Condition to diſturb the Repoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> or Re-attempt the breach of Treaties.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, It is evident that the Ultimate end of all the <hi>French</hi> Deſigns is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Monarchy to which their boundleſs Ambition hath made them aſpire now for ſome time: This needs no proof, the matter ſpeaks of it ſelf, and every body is fully convinced of it; Only we ſhall obſerve here, that this great Project was form'd during the Miniſtry of <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> and we ſhall now take a ſhort view of all the Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Methods which have been made uſe of by the <hi>French,</hi> to accompliſh their deſign from that time to this very day.</p>
            <p>It was then that famous Miniſter who (while he applyed himſelf to weaken the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> by the bloody Wars which he induſtriouſly fomented in the Empire) did lay the Foundation of this Important Deſign, by the taking of <hi>Rochelle</hi> and other places then Poſſeſſed by the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> After the Death of this Cardinal, <hi>Mazarin</hi> his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor carried on the Deſign, by <hi>depriving the People of their</hi> Liberty, <hi>the Parliament of their Rights and Priviledges,</hi> and <hi>the Nobility and Gentry of their Credit and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> The <hi>French King</hi> by this means being rais'd above the Law, he became Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Maſter of the Lives and Eſtates of all his Subjects, ſo that without any Obſtacle he impoſed what Taxes he pleaſed upon them, and rendred himſelf Maſter of vaſt Sums, which he hath imployed ſince in the Execution of his Ambitious Deſigns.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102916:2"/>
            <p>All Letts and Impediments being removed out of the way at Home, his buſineſs was not to ſurmount the Difficulties from abroad, and to compaſs his deſign, he found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to divide thoſe Potentates whom he intended to ſubdue, and to bring ſome of them over to his ſide, while he ſhould ſwallow up others: Part of this he did effectuate by his <hi>Leu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s d'ors,</hi> and the reſt he brought about by his Unfaithfulneſs, Cunning and Treachery; but let us particularly take a view of the Operation, which theſe different Methods have had ſince the Coronation of <hi>Charles</hi> II. King of <hi>England.</hi> That Prince was hardly well ſeated on his Throne, when <hi>France</hi> prevail'd with him to make War againſt <hi>Holland,</hi> with a deſign not only to weaken the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> This War was followed by that betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spainard,</hi> the Former taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way many places from the Latter in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> under the unjuſt pretence of the Queen of <hi>Frances</hi> Right of Succeſſion.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Troubles were no ſooner appeas'd by the Mediation of other Potentates, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that of the <hi>States General;</hi> when the <hi>French</hi> Kings Ambition rais'd up new ones, by the Rupture of the Treaty of <hi>Aix La Chapelle,</hi> and the War of 1672. It was chiefly upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> that <hi>France</hi> had an evil Eye; looking upon them as the greateſt Obſtacle of their unjuſt deſigns, and having Sworn their Ruine: The <hi>French</hi> K. was ſo dexterous to bring over the K. <hi>England</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> to his Party, after he had Corrupted by his Gold, thoſe who were in chief truſt in <hi>Holland,</hi> and found powerful Factions againſt the Family of <hi>Orange.</hi> The <hi>Hollanders</hi> were at that time ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; repoſing themſelves upon the Publick Faith of the Treaty, and were wholly taken up with their Commerce, when on a ſudden thoſe Three Powers did fall in upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and without the particular Aſſiſtance of Heav'n they had been infallibly ruined. But ſeeing you know what were the Conſequences of that dangerous War; it's needleſs to repeat them: only I ſhall obſerve that it was the Cauſe of the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> being Reſtored to the Dignity of his Anceſtors againſt the mind of the <hi>French</hi> King, who would have had him brought under, and that this happy Reſtoration was alſo the ſafety of the <hi>State.</hi> And here I cannot omit to make you ſenſible of the great miſtake which the <hi>Dutch</hi> made, they knew the ill deſign which <hi>France</hi> had upon them, and had juſt ſmarted under the Effects of it, they were not ignorant of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Unfaithfulneſs, his Tricks, and his Cabals. Yet, nevertheleſs tho' they were but juſt delivered from the Brink of Ruine, by the Valour and Safe Conduct of the <hi>Prince</hi>; they were cheated with falſe appearances, and clapt up a Peace againſt the Mind of their Illuſtrious <hi>Stadholder,</hi> who very well foreſaw the Conſequences of it, and that alſo at ſuch a time when the <hi>French</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned all the places which they had taken from them, and when they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſupported by their <hi>Allies,</hi> and accordingly they found cauſe to Repent, for ſcarcely was that unhappy Peace concluded when it was violated by <hi>France,</hi> who immediately fell' upon the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> with all manner of Injuſtice, Violence, Depredations, Military Executions, by Fire and all ſorts of Crueltys: Then they Eſtabliſht Soveraign Chambers, or Courts at <hi>Metz,</hi> whereby the Prince and other Members of the Empire were Summond and Deſpoil'd of their Territories and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, under the Pretext of <hi>Dependancies</hi> had <hi>Re-unions:</hi> Complaints hereof were made but to no purpoſe, and then Conferences were held to Regulate Differences, to which Iſſued in Converting the <hi>Peace</hi> into a 20 <hi>Tears Truce.</hi> Which tho it left the <hi>French</hi> in Poſſeſſion of <hi>Strasburg</hi> and many other places which they had made themſelves Maſter of in time of profound Peace: Yet it did not ſtop the Career of their Violence and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations; but on the contrary, it: hightned them, until, in fine, they intirely ruin'd their own Proteſtants, and by the ſecret League which the <hi>French</hi> King made with King <hi>James,</hi> put himſelf in a Condition to bring <hi>England</hi> under his Yoke; and Immerſe the United Provinces in Irrecoverable Ruine. But the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was the Glorious Inſtrument whom God made uſe of on this occaſion to Ward off: the fatal blow, and it is to his Prudence and Valour that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> owe their Liberty, and his Elevation to the <hi>Brittiſh Throne,</hi> did as effectually ſave <hi>Holland</hi> then, as his Reſtoration to the Office of <hi>Stadholder</hi> did deliver that Republick before.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102916:2"/>
            <p>After this deduction of the infamous Method by which the <hi>French</hi> King ſubjected the Princes and States of <hi>Europe;</hi> it is to conceive the Reaſons which obliged thoſe <hi>Powers</hi> to unite themſelves in ſuch a great and mighty League againſt that Crown. It was not meerly for their own Defence, and to prevent their being forthwith enſlaved; nor was it to lay down Arms as ſoon as <hi>France</hi> ſhould propoſe a Peace and promiſe to obſerve the ſame, ſince Experience may teach them that ſhe makes no ſcruple of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Word and Oath; but the Cauſe of their League was to reſtore <hi>Europe</hi> to its former Tranquillity, by reducing <hi>France</hi> to ſuch a Condition, as to render her uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of troubling their Quiet any more. Otherwiſe what profit ſhould they have by this Alliance. What fruit ſhould they reap of all the Care they have taken, all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which they have been at, and the vaſt Treaſures which they have expended? Can Perſons of the loweſt degree of Senſe be guilty of ſuch a piece of Conduct; and don't we know that to begin a Work and not bring it to Perfection, is the way to loſe all our Labour? It is certain then that the Allies propos'd to themſelves the continuance of the War until ſuch time as <hi>France</hi> ſhould give ſolid Proof of her Converſion, by a faithful Reſtitution of all that ſhe has uſurp'd ſince the Peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and the Treaty of the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> or be compelled thereunto by an indiſpenſible Neceſſity. Thoſe were the true Motives which prevail'd with the Allies to unite for their own Preſervation: Then let us ſee whether the Reaſons of them be ceaſed, and if the Peace now offer'd by <hi>France</hi> can reſtore the Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſecure it againſt the horrible Attempts of that Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Crown:</p>
            <p>For as to what concerns the <hi>French</hi> King's Deſigns, We need do no more but examine his Conduct, and we ſhall quickly find that they are ſtill the ſame; The Maſter-piece of his Politicks is to re-eſtabliſh his Affairs by Treaties of Peace, which he can break when he pleaſes. Did he not impudently violate that of <hi>Aix la Chappelle,</hi> that of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and the Twenty Years Truce, and who can be Guarantee, that he will not alſo break that which he now offers, if we be ſo imprudent as to accept it; Can we truſt his Word? Can we rely upon his Oath or his Fidelity? Does not Experience convince us, that he avowedly breaks the moſt ſacred Ties, that he mocks at all Laws Humane and Divine, and that he deſpiſes Religion, and prophanes our Altars? Can Chriſtian Princes put Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a Crown which hath made an Alliance with the <hi>Turk,</hi> ſolicited the Sworn Enemy of Chriſtendom, to break the Truce with the Emperor; and hath ſince furniſhed the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels with Men and Mony to carry on their unjuſt Enterprizes?</p>
            <p>Let us once, at leaſt, learn to be wiſe at our own Coſt. We found that the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen</hi> ſet <hi>Europe</hi> upon the brink of Deſtruction, unto which ſhe muſt have undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly fallen, had not Heaven it ſelf prevented it. In effect, had it not been for the Wonderful Revolution in <hi>England,</hi> that Kingdom had been ere now at the Devotion of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> loſt beyond recovery; and ſeeing it was ſo, I leave it to thoſe who have nothing left them but the very ſhadow of Reaſon to judge what would have been the Deſtiny of the other Princes and States of <hi>Europe;</hi> and if <hi>France</hi> concluded the Peace at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> that ſhe might the more aſſuredly effectual the Deſtruction of all the Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of <hi>Europe.</hi> It is certain, that her deſign in offering Peace now, is only to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it with the more Facility. This is evident from her Maxims and Conduct. We cannot ſay that ſhe hath ſincerely reſolv'd to change them, ſeeing ſhe mentions nothing of Reſtitution, at leaſt, of that which ſhe is obliged to make, but deſigns to maintain her ſelf in a Condition to renue her Infractions when ſhe pleaſes, or rather when ſhe hath made up the great Expence of her Men and Mony, which her prodigious Efforts have engag'd her in.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that <hi>France</hi> means honeſtly at this time, muſt we grant Peace as ſoon as ſhe demands it; and muſt ſhe not give Satisfaction to thoſe Powers upon whom ſhe hath dar'd to commit the moſt cruel and diſgraceful Outrages? She hath treated them all with an unſupportable Pride. The Pope hath felt the Effects of it as well as others, his quality of Head of the Church not being ſufficient to guard him againſt the Inſults of <hi>France:</hi> The Emperor and <hi>K.</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Princes and States of the Empire and <hi>Italy,</hi>

Not to inſiſt on it, that in Juſtice ſhe ought to pay all the Charges of that Vexatious War; in which ſhe hath engaged the Confederates. Hath ſhe not treated Soveraignty it ſelf, with the utmoſt diſdain: what Inſolence can be named that is not to be found in the <hi>Devices</hi> and <hi>Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> which are to be ſeen at <hi>Paris,</hi> and what Indignity is there with which ſhe hath not Treated, the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the Inſcription upon the Gate of St. <hi>Denis.</hi> Thoſe People who are the Principal object or the hatred and malice of <hi>France</hi> are particulary concerned to prevent the Peace, being obliged to oppoſe it for their own ſafety, ſeeing they muſt unavoidably be the firſt who fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>French</hi> Tyranny, after the diſſolution of the Confederacy by this Peace, and then what will become of their Religion, Liberty and Trade, ſh'ant they be brought under an Ignominious Slavery deprived of the Liberty of their Conſciences, and Subjected to a Tyranny, beyond all that ever was heard of; and can only be repreſented by that which the <hi>French Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>New Converts</hi> did, and do groan under, being Slavery, Barbarous, that it hath been condemned by a <hi>Pope,</hi> as it is at this day by all men of honeſty, either Papiſts or Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>It is evident by theſe reaſons which I have alledged, that the <hi>French</hi> King hath neither chang'd his deſign nor conduct, and that the Peace which he offers to the <hi>Allies,</hi> is only to deceive them after he hath divided them, and to deſtroy them one after another; but whether he be in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to do this, or whether the <hi>Allies</hi> have rendred him incapable of renewing his Infractions, is that which we are now to Examine, to compare then the <hi>French</hi> King now with what he was, when he broke the Treatys of <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> and <hi>Nimeguen:</hi> He is much Stronger in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and weaker in another. He is much ſtronger becauſe he hath extended his Conqueſts ſince, and rendred himſelf Maſter of many ſtrong places, both in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> but he is much weaker becauſe of the Extream Miſery which reigns throughout his Kingdom, and the Conſumption of his Treaſures. If the <hi>Allies</hi> accept the Peace, they have hitherto done nothing, and <hi>France</hi> will remain more Powerful than ever. If on the Contrary they continue the War, they will have the ſatisfaction to ſee <hi>France</hi> fall under its own weight. We muſt then conclude, that in reſpect of the firſt, the <hi>French</hi> King inſtead of being humbled, will reap great Advantage, and that in reſpect of the Second, he is in ſuch Circumſtances that we may juſtly, hope to ſee him fall of a ſudden. He knows this well enough, and being ſenſible that he will gain all by a Peace, and on the contrary loſe all by the Continuation of the War: We muſt not wonder if he tuake ſuch preſſing Inſtances to obtain the Former, and Ward off the Latter. This is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which obliges him to make ſuch Prodigious Efforts to draw the <hi>Allies</hi> into Peace, which will be as prejudicial to them as advantagious to him. But what Method ſhall we take, ſay ſome, to oppoſe the <hi>French Torrent. That Crown has every day new advantages, and we the misfortune of conſiderable loſſes, if that continue,</hi> France <hi>will ſtill be in a condition to preſcribe Laws to us, and we ſhall at laſt be conſtrained to receive Peace on much harder terms than thoſe which are now offered.</hi> This way of Reaſoning is a meer Illuſion. Affairs are not ſo deſperate, nor is it ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to put a ſtop to the Progreſs of <hi>France.</hi> That Crown hath carried ſome Places of ſtrength, and occaſioned us ſome Loſſes at Sea this year, it is true; but the <hi>French</hi> King hath exhauſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for that end, and he is no more in a Condition to continue the VVar with that ſame Vigour. VVhereas on the contrary the Allies, who have almoſt made no Efforts, are ſtill poſſeſſed of Reſſources, whereof <hi>France</hi> has none. So that that there wants nothing but a good-will to obtain what we deſire, and if every one do their part, we ſhall ſee ſuch Armies on foot next year, as will force our great Enemy to abandon his prize. In fine, there are only two things to chuſe, <hi>viz. Slavery</hi> or <hi>Liberty,</hi> if we make Peace, we cannot eſcape falling into the one, and if we continue the War vvith Vigor, vve ſhall infallibly preſerve the other.</p>
            <p>Shall we who are Dutch-men, loſe by a Cowardly Imprudence that dear Liberty which our Fathers purchas'd by ſhedding their Blood with ſo much Generoſity, which the Princes of <hi>Orange</hi> procur'd us by an admirable Valour; and which the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Repreſentative of that Illuſtrious Family, Defends ſtill, by expoſing his Sacred Perſon to the greateſt of Dangers. It is by his wiſe Conduct and ſingular Courage that we have been many times deliver'd from the brink of Deſtruction; Let's not then be ſo void of Senſe as to put our ſelves again in danger of falling into it without hopes of Retrieve. Let's Back his Majeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s good Intentions, who always gave us wiſe Counſels. Let's Generouſly employ our Eſtates, our Perſons, and our Lives for the preſervation of our Religion, our Liberty, our Wives and our Children. VVe have no occaſion to doubt of good Succeſs, provided that we acquit our ſelves as we ought. Our Cauſe is Juſt. and that of our Enemy every way Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Soon or Late, Heaven will humble his Pride, and we ſhall enjoy the advantage and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Theſe Sir, are the Reaſons which I had to Communicate to make it evident that a Peace muſt needs be Fatal to us, I may perhaps enlarge upon them when occaſion offers, and alſo furniſh you with new ones. In the mean time I am,</p>
